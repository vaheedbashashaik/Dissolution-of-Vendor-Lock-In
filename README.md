The results of the experiments in this paper indicate that the proposed framework appears efficient in a practical situation based on the outcomes.
Purpose: To reproduce the proposed methodology this document has been prepared.

Observations: 
1.	These steps are prepared by decoding the algorithm and for manual execution. You might see more series of steps in the screenshots. So, please compare only the series of steps of algorithm and Manual executions.
2.	After every step execution the server screenshot provided, and the same text copied also copied in the text format.

Code: The github has these operations are automated, no manual execution required. These steps are for reader’s understanding.

Software: Please use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Oracle database.

Infrastructure:

Server Type	Resource Configurations
	CPU’s	RAM	SWAP
Active/Primary	8	31	7
Passive/Standby	2	6	3




Keywords:
1.	Active or Primary database refers to the same word.
2.	Passive or standby refers to the same word.
